# Keeper-ReactPractice
The goal of this app was to practice what I learned about the React.js framework from a Udemy course. 

This webpage lets you add/delete notes using React design principles.

## How to run:
1. cd to the Keeper-ReactPractice folder
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. The webpage will pop up on your browser at "http://localhost:3000/"
